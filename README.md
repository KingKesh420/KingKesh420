### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
    I am Keshawn, currently learning to programming through a Software Engineering Diploma and also learning from Github Education. I'm thinking about doing a Computer Animation and Computer Science in order to achieve my goal. My goal/career path is to become a Game Developer/Game Designer, and hopefully creating fun, addicting, beautiful and exicting games by exploring my creativity and skills, and maybe with a team too. Fun Fact about me is that my favourite colour is red.
